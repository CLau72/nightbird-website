# nightbird-website

This website is based off The Odin Project landing page project. Instead of going off the exact layout in the prompt, I used it as a starting point for my friends' brewry website. This may evolve beyond the inital landing page prompt, but for now it's pretty close.

This project was mainly an exercise in:

- Using CSS
- Flexbox for layouts
- Making things not look like complete garbage
